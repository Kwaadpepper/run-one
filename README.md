# run-one
Bash script that runs one app based on the executable file only

Why not use run-one ?

run-one is actually based on arguments as well as the program name.
This is enoying if you just need to use to progam to launch one instance.
Also run-one does not bring the window to front.

This script intend is to fill the gaps of run-one.
